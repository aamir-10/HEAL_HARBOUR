Disease Prediction Model Evaluation
In our project, we have implemented several prediction models to accurately predict diseases based on blood samples. After thorough evaluation and comparison, we have determined that the XGBoost classifier outperforms other models with an accuracy of approximately 98%.
 Prediction Models Evaluated
1. Gradient Boosting Classifier: It is an ensemble learning method that builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects errors made by the previous ones to improve prediction accuracy.
2. XGBoost: An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed for efficient and accurate large-scale machine learning.
3. Decision Tree Classifier: A model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
4. Logistic Regression: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

Evaluation Results
- XGBoost: Accuracy - ~98%
- Decision Tree Classifier: Accuracy - ~94%
- Logistic Regression: Accuracy - ~88%
- Gradient Boosting Classifier - ~96%

 Conclusion
Based on our evaluation, the XGBoost classifier demonstrates superior performance with an accuracy of approximately 98%. Therefore, we have selected XGBoost as the primary prediction model for our disease prediction web application.
 Next Steps
- Optimization: Further optimize the selected model for enhanced performance and efficiency.
- Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or data preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
- Deployment: Integrate the chosen model into the web application for real-time disease prediction.
